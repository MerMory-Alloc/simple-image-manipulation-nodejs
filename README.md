# Image Processing and Merging Module

This Node.js module utilizes the Jimp and Canvas libraries to process and merge images. The `processAndSplitImage` function resizes input images and splits them into two halves. The `mergeImages` function then merges these processed images into a single output file. The dimensions and paths are configurable, allowing users to customize the image processing workflow based on their specific requirements.

the `app.js` contains the actual implementations of the functions and the `main.js` contains a code for how to use them.
